A simple one-page (literally, just one html file with scripts inline) application using AngularJS to asynchronously calculate basic hash values given a single input.

Currently the Crypto-JS project is being used to calculate the hashes.  I hope to collect different implementations of a wide variety of algorithms (old, new, emerging, usefull, useless, broken, etc) over time, just so they're all in one static place.
